    "## Polymorphism and Code Reuse\n",
    "\n",
    "I guess \"Polymorphism and Code Reuse\" is kind of redundant. According to Ye Olde Wikipedia, *polymorphism is the provision of a single interface to entities of different types or the use of a single symbol to represent multiple different types,* So it's code reuse related to types, which is exactly what I'm going to talk about. I guess macros are also a kind of code reuse, but this isn't about that.\n",
    "\n",
    "Julia allows a fully dynamic approach to typing if desired, though it is strongly recommended to use types when defining structs for performance reason. We have already seen many function/method definitions which are dynamically typed.\n",
    "\n",
    "This means functions are polymorphic by default. Like Python, you can send any type to any function, and you won't get an error until you hit an interface which isn't provided for that type. Julia could theoretically catch these kinds of errors earlier, but it doesn't do that, since compilation of functions happens at runtime the first time a function is required, not prior to any code execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Generally speaking, idiomatic Julia specifies functions as dynamically as possible and uses type declarations for leveraging multiple dispatch. However, if you want to get your type errors earlier than later (never a bad thing), you may also add declarations for that, though they will still only be caught at runtime (just potentially much earlier).\n",
    "\n",
    "However, using type declarations does not mean that one forgoes polymorphism in Julia. Julia supports ad-hoc polymorphism with multiple dispatch, parametric polymorphism with generics and first-class type constructors, and subtyping with abstract types. Of course, all these features can be used together to create well-typed, but highly polymorphic functions and structs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Inheritance with Abstract Types\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're familiar with classical object orientated languages, or even a prototypical language like JS, you may be glad (or not) to learn that Julia also has inheritance. You may be displeased (or not) to learn that it's upside-down from how it works in classical OO--but at least it isn't prototypical.\n",

One thing that annoys me in Julia is that there's no way to enforce the implementation of certain interfaces on subtypes, so document it well! One possible benefit to this is that you don't actually need to implement interfaces for methods of a supertype you don't intend to use. I'd rather have an enforcible contract, but them's the breaks. In typical Julia style, you get a runtime error about missing methods instead. *\\*sigh\\**\n",

    "\n",
    "One common complaint about the lack of classes in Julia is that structs cannot inherit data fields from super classes. I'm of the opinion that over-zealous use inheritance (particularly of data layout) tends to result in spaghetti code, but I suppose there are cases where it's useful. If you want to use inheritance in Julia, you may have to keep writing the same field-name over and over in all the structs. I think this is good because it's more explicit. Your mileage may vary.\n",
    "\n",
    "In any case, composition is generally considered a superior pattern to inheritance, at least in part because it's more explicit. The strategy for compositional inheritance is to create structs that have the type with the required interface as a field rather than a super type, and then optionally forward the appropriate methods to that field. Julia makes this easier with `eval`, since you can forward methods with a loop. It is typical in Julia to use `eval` for preprocessing of this sort."

    "\n",
    "Traits are sort of a contract with the compiler that a certain type is going to implement the right interfaces, and can therefore be used as an argument for any function that requires that interface. It is an alternative to classical inheritance which is superior, in my opinion. A class normally only has one super type, but a type could implement many traits. Yes, there is multiple inheritance, but that's the highway to hell, whereas traits tend to keep the spaghetti monster at bay. Traits in Rust, Interfaces in Go and type classes in Haskell are all examples of Traits in different languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "Julia doesn't have traits as a language-level feature, but there is a popular pattern for implementing traits which occurs frequently in the standard library, called the Holy Trait. While this is an awesome name, it is not so called because it exhibits exceptional holiness--if anything, it's more given to sin. Rather, it gets its name from the gentleman who suggested it in a github issue--Julia contributer, Tim Holy.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can read a bit about this pattern [here](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/methods/#Trait-based-dispatch-1) in the official docs, and the [github discussion](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/issues/2345#issuecomment-54537633) where it came up originally. One area you might need to use one of the traits in the standard library is when implementing your own iterable type. There is class of traits called `Base.IteratorSize` that can be used to give hints about the size of your iterable so that space can be allocated more efficiently when broadcasting and mapping and things. For example, as it stands now, there is no method for determining the length of the above linked list implementation, so we could add the `Base.SizeUnknown` trait.\n",
    "\n",
    "```julia\n",
    "Base.IteratorSize(::List) = Base.SizeUnkown()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "However, we could also implement a length function:"

    "Base.length(::Nothing) = 0\n",

    "This will then be used in various functions around the standard library for efficient allocation. Of course, there is still a question about how efficient it can possibly be to have to traverse the list just to get its length, but that's one of several reasons why one should avoid linked lists in performance-sensitive code. It's just an example, man.\n",
    "\n",
    "Anyway, the standard library documentation for traits will effectively show you how to use the traits it provides, but it oddly stops short of actually showing you how to create your own traits. In its simplest form, a trait is just an empty struct and a dispatch that throws an error in the most general case. You then check for the trait by using the constructor in a method dispatch."

Because Julia code is dynamically typed by default, you could simply take a devil-may-care approach to it and just write your function generically and not care about safeties like traits. However, there are obvious benefits when you add inheritance into the mix. This allows different ways to implement the trait's interface and lets methods optimize against different types of traits. If we were to implement our own version of `Base.IteratorSize`, it might look like this (actually, it looks exactly like this):"

Not sure why they chose to do this, because what happens is it assumes your iterable implements a length function and then crashes when it doesn't find one, rather than letting you know you need to implement `IteratorSize(::MyType)` with one of the four options, since there are plenty of cases where the size of an iterator is unknown.
